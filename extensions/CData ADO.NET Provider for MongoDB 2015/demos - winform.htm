<h1>MongoDB Data Provider 2015 &nbsp;-&nbsp; Demo Applications</h1>


<font color=#111111>
NOTE: These projects are mostly simple demos, and by no means complete applications.
They are intended to illustrate the usage of the MongoDB Data Provider components in a
simple, straightforward way. What we are hoping to demonstrate is how simple
it is to program with our tools. If you want to know more about them, or if 
you have questions, please visit

<td>The Query Browser demo shows the basic features of the CData ADO.NET Provider for MongoDB. After establishing a connection, you can browse the tables and columns. You can also issue any SQL query to the data source. Results are displayed in a data grid, which you can use to update values and save them back to the data source.</tr>
